MBO Theme for Brackets
======================
This theme is taken from https://github.com/Jacse/themes-for-brackets
It has been updated by me to work in the Built in brackets Theme Support in Brackets Release 0.42

#Notes:
According to the Brackets wiki page for creating themes [found here](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Creating+Themes)
Brackets _only_ supports editor themes. Meaning unlike the themes used with the ["Themes For Brackets"](https://github.com/Jacse/themes-for-brackets) extension, which is where I got this theme from, this theme will only update the text area of Brackets. All other UI elements remain unchanged.
